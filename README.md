# :wave: Hi, I'm Julien!

Nothing drives me more than understanding complex systems. 
I'm at my best, when I face abstract intellectual challenges that force me to
navigate uncharted territory. I welcome frustrating days of being completely at sea 
with something new I learn, because I know the deep satisfaction I encounter when
finally I start to see some structure. Ok, it's often rather weeks at sea, sometimes months.
The work always pays off, eventually. 

Having a tendency to dwell in theory, discovering coding felt like salvation.
Did you know that by juggling around some comfortably abstract concepts and 
structuring them in source code, you can - I sh*t you not - actually solve 
day to day problems??? Well, why didn't you tell me sooner:question:

It was rather cumbersome to get there on my own, I can tell you! First, I 
had to learn discipline, so I spent five years at the army. Alas, that was too much 
of it, so it took me a considarable time studying literature and philosophy to brush the abudant 
discipline off. I then spent two years in Poland, learning a completely unfamiliar 
language and working in customer service for an international e-commerce company.
Back in Germany I worked two years in logistics and another two years in roofing. 
And only then did destiny arrange for a meeting with coding.

In July 2024 I started professional training to become a software developer at GFN GmbH in Berlin.
Topics I learned about include:
+ basics in business administration and company structures
+ computer hardware
+ computer networks
+ operating systems 
+ databases 
+ it-security
+ IoT 
+ software design 
+ data structures and algorithms

 More practically I gained skills in the following areas:
+ Python
+ Java 
+ C
+ HTML, CSS, JavaScript
+ Git
+ TDD
+ SQL
+ design patterns
+ UML
+ Scrum

I have worked with PyCharm, IDEA, Visual Studio, VS Code, Eclipse, Arduino IDE. 

Currently, I'm most interested in C Programming and related low level applications, 
gaining a lot of foundational knowledge. I'm working on Debian, with Neovim, gcc, gdb, make and ctags.

Enjoy browsing my code and please be kind to me, I know I am but a few steps down a long and winding road!
