# :wave: Hi, I'm Julien!

I'm about one year into programming and I am working with C, Java and Python.  

Currently, I'm most interested in C programming and related low level applications, as well as in communication protocols, 
gaining a lot of foundational knowledge.

See my site for more information about me: julien-zigan.github.io

Enjoy browsing my code and please be kind to me, I know I am but a few steps down a long and winding road!
