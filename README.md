# :wave: Hi, I'm Julien!

I'm about one year into programming and I am working with Java, Python, C, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  

Currently, I'm learning backend development with Spring and Spring Boot.

See [my github page](https://julien-zigan.github.io) for more information about me!

Enjoy browsing my code and please be kind to me, I know I am but a few steps down a long and winding road!

ðŸŒ±
